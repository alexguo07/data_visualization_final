Professor Uhe

IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

One of the greatest takeaways from the data visualization course has been the profound understanding of how effectively tailored visual representations can enhance the interpretation and communication of data. Throughout the course, and particularly evident in assignments like this one, I've learned the significant role that aesthetics play in data visualization. By applying various color schemes, I've been able to make complex data more accessible and digestible. Moreover, the ability to filter and sort data before visualizing, as practiced with sorting sectors by average salary, reinforces the importance of preprocessing in achieving meaningful insights. This skill is crucial in ensuring that visualizations not only capture attention but also convey the right message clearly and accurately. Overall, the course has equipped me the technical skills to transform raw data into compelling visual stories that can influence decision-making and drive data-driven strategies, which will help me become a data scientist in the future.

I think Professor Uhe is already doing a great job; the course is very interesting, and he provides very thorough feedback on our assignments, sometimes even on an individual basis. If I were to suggest an improvement, I think integrating teaching with data science websites like Kaggle and DataCamp would make the course even more engaging.
